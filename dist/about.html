        <p>From the first time I wrote "Hello World" in HTML and it appeared in my browser I knew I was hooked. Programming hasn't just become a job for me. It opened up a world of opportunities in which I can grow and be challenged while improving my skills. What started with that simple "Hello world" turned into a full-flegded passion that only gets more exciting as time goes by. Please refer to the My Work page to see some of my projects.  </p>
